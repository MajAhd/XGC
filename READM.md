10 Certified Principles for Leading Tech Teams Straight into the Abyss

## 1. Ghost Communication

Skip the 1:1s, cancel team meetings, and write cryptic messages in Slack at 11pm like a tech oracle. Bonus points if you use phrases like “we need to be more aligned” without ever explaining on what. Let them read your mind — it’s called "empowerment."

## 2. Hire Now, Regret Later

If they can fog a mirror and copy/paste from Stack Overflow, welcome aboard. Fire them at the first sign of critical thinking.

## 3. Hovercraft Leadership

Trust is earned, but never given. Review every commit, second-guess every idea, and always say “hmm” before rejecting a PR.

## 4. Secrets are Strategy

Keep product direction, salary info, and layoffs on a need-to-panic basis. Transparency just makes people ask questions.

## 5. One Brain to Rule Them All

You already have all the answers. Meetings are just opportunities to hear yourself say them out loud.
You don’t need input you need quiet while you ideate. Decisions are faster when they come from one person, especially if that person hasn’t written code in five years. Tell engineers “This isn’t a democracy” while quoting Steve Jobs incorrectly.

## 6. Tech Debt = Job Security

Shipping fast is what matters. Let the next sucker figure out why the backend is duct-taped together with TODO comments.
Deadlines over design. Always. If someone brings up scalability or test coverage, accuse them of “overengineering.” When the system collapses, blame the intern and suggest a hackathon to rewrite the entire backend in Rust.

## 7. Blame-Driven Development

Nothing motivates like fear.Publicly dissect postmortems to identify "ownership failures" Make sure the team knows every outage is a character flaw. Say “This can’t happen again” after it definitely will.
If something breaks, find someone to pin it on — preferably someone not in the meeting. Accountability is a group activity… for other people.

## 8. Burnout as a Service (BaaS)

Promote “extreme ownership” by giving everyone 3 jobs and no boundaries. Reward all-nighters with a pizza and a shout-out in Slack. Dismiss burnout concerns as “low resilience” and suggest a mindfulness app you’ve never used.
The team isn’t tired they’re just not passionate enough. Real engineers love working through dinner.

## 9. Hero Mode Activated

Real leaders code in prod and push to main. Solve crises by jumping in, rewriting everything, and telling the team “I had to clean it up.” Make yourself the bottleneck, then complain no one takes initiative.
If it can’t be solved by you personally at 3am with hardcoded credentials, it’s not worth solving. Delegation is for the weak.

## 10. Learning is Optional (Ego is Not)

You peaked in 2016 and haven’t read a blog post since. Dismiss new ideas with “We tried that before” or “It won’t scale,” regardless of context. Call it “being pragmatic” while quietly Googling what your staff engineer just said.
You read half of a leadership book in 1930. That’s enough. Conferences and feedback are just distractions from your greatness.
