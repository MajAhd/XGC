# eXecutive Go Clown (XGC) License™

(Because nothing builds a tech empire like chaos in a suit.)

We, the self-appointed Visioneers™, proudly commit to these sacred tenets of gloriously unhinged tech leadership:

## Individuals and Interactions?

Only if they CC you. Otherwise, let them sort it out in a passive-aggressive JIRA comment thread.

## Working Software?

As long as it demos well in a Zoom call and doesn’t crash during the investor pitch.

## Customer Collaboration?

Why talk to users when you can assume what they need based on a hunch you had in the shower?

## Responding to Change?

We don’t pivot — we swirl. Preferably mid-sprint and without telling anyone.

## 👑 The XGC Core Principles™

- Micromanage everything – Trust is for junior managers.

- Meetings > Meaning – Never solve a problem if it can be calendarized.

- Transparency is weakness – Confuse them into compliance.

- Feedback is mutiny – Shut it down with “Let’s circle back.”

- Tech debt is just future fun – You’ll be CTO of something else by then anyway.

- Burnout is a feature – Hustle until they hallucinate scalability.

- Ship it live – Testing is for interns and cowards.

- Blame is scalable – Use it generously.

Leadership isn’t about building teams. It’s about building a personal brand on top of one.
